## Description

**"MagnusMovie"** Is a frontend part of the endProject,  for the Full Stack Java Developer course at 
[HackerU](https://www.hackeru.co.il/). 

This React App is developed to provide information about movies, allowing users to leave and read movie reviews. It is built using TypeScript and styled with Tailwind CSS, incorporating various React libraries.

- User authentication and token management.
- Front-end display and interaction with server responses.

## Application Structure and Routing
- Main Entry Point (`index.js`): Setup context providers and React Query client.
- Application Component (`App.js`): Defines routes and conditional rendering based on user authentication.

## Core Functionalities and Patterns
- Contexts and Hooks: `AuthContext`, `DarkModeContext`.
